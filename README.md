Dataset we used for this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset

We couldn't upload the files themselves because it was far too large for github's upload limit.

What are the popularity rankings of video genres for 2020, 2021, and 2022? Have they changed?
The US category rankings did not go how I expected them to. The Average Views increase in 2021 from 2020 made sense given how much of the US was shut down for most of it, YouTube would be an easy assumption as a pastime during quarantine. What surprised me most was that the biggest category shift didn’t happen until 2022 and it went from Autos and Vehicles being the highest watched to Science and Technology. I would have guessed before seeing this that Science and Technology or News and Politics would be toward the top in those years due to covid and the particularly incendiary election cycle. And as you can see, by 2022 News and Politics and Science and Tech both skyrocketed compared to Autos from the two years prior.

What are the most popular genres per country (Throughout 2020 to 2022)?
The most popular genre in France is by far Music. It dominates every engagement metric and is the obvious most popular genre so I’ll just chat about the others. As we saw in question 1, gaming started off as a big favorite but then was overtaken by others in the subsequent years. It’s still near the top of the engagement metrics despite this severe drop off. Film, Entertainment, and Sports are very close to each other following Music but interestingly only Entertainment stays towards the top in Likes and Comments while the other two fall behind. This relationship between views and the other engagement metrics is different in France than it is the other two countries.

The most popular genres in the US across the 3 years we analyzed were Autos and Vehicles first, as I already mentioned, followed by People and Blogs and Travel and Events. Engagement data is very much in line with what one would assume. The view count does appear to correlate very closely with both Likes and Comments. I found this surprising because I would’ve assumed that topics that are generally more divisive would have a higher average engagement relative to their views but this doesn’t appear to be the case. 

Similarities and Differences:
Our primary question was what are the key differences between what trending videos on YouTube between Japan, France, and the US?
The first major similarity is how much more popular Music is in both Japan and France than every other genre. While these two pages were dominated by Music, the US data shows us much more varied popularity. Japan and France also maintained the status quo across all 3 years while the US saw a major shift in what content was desired from YouTube in 2022. 
Japan and the US both showed a strong correlation between views and the other two engagement metrics we analyzed on the top genres. France had much more variation.
